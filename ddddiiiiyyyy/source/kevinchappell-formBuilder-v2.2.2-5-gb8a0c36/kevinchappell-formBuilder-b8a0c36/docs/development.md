# Development

Here we'll cover a few common tasks developers might face when setting up formBuilder.

## Install Dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```
or
```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Local development
Once you've installed the project and [development](http://formbuilder.online/contributing) dependencies you can get a local version running by running:
```bash
$ npm start
```

This will run webpack and open a new browser tab and that serves a running version of the plugin.

## Custom Controls
See the Control and Control Plugin Architecture Documentation
